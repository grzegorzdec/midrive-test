# Midrive Tech Test

This repo contains the data and brief descriptions for completing a Midrive technical test.

## Guidelines
- We would like you to spend 2-3 hours on these tests (or less if you're confident!).
- Don't spend more than the alotted time per exercise, we want to see what you can do in that time. It's not a race!
- Submit your code in a private repo / archive, we would like everyone to think of their own solutions.
- Feel free to use any libraries, frameworks or tooling you are familiar with.
- Google is your friend.
- So is Stack Overflow!
- Exercises will be assessed using macOS or a Linux system so please ensure your code can be compiled / run
- Provide a detailed readme if relevant.
