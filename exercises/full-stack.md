# Midrive Full Stack Exercise

In 3 hours, build a simple REST API to serve the data contained within the `data.json` file in the root of this repository and an interface to display it.

At Midrive we use the following technologies to build our systems.

- NodeJS
- PostgreSQL
- Express
- React
- Redux
- Webpack

However you may use any technology you are comfortable with.

## Data
The `data.json` file contains 25 random lesson objects describing driving lessons in various states.
Below is a outline of the properties present on each lesson object.

|Property  |Type       |Description|
|----------|-----------|-----------|
|location  |String     |Human readable location name|
|status    |Enum:String (incomplete, complete, cancelled)|The current state of the lesson|
|startDate |Date       |ISO8601 representation of a lessons start date|
|route     |GeoJSON    |GeoJSON representation of the route driven on a lesson|

## Spec
Implement the endpoints below to fetch all the lessons and build an interface to display the lesson data in a sensible format. Use your experience and creativity to guide your design process.

**Required features**
- Display lesson route information on a map
- Lesson status filtering options

### `GET` /lessons
Retrieve a list of all lessons with routes omitted
### `GET` /lessons/:status
Retrieve a list of all lessons with a specific status

If you still have time or have some ideas of your own, add them in as well. We'd love to see some unit tests!
